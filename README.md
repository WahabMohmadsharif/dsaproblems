# dsaproblems
These are DSA problems solved by Me.
Objective is to solve the problems with consistency and daily,
Approach: Attempt solving problem on whiteboard and implement the working solution in 30-45 mins with comments.
If Problem is not solved on whiteboard and with trial run then sample inputs/outputs carry on with another problem and come back to current problem later.
Solving 2-3 problems per day is good effort if we can continue it for next 4 months.
2 Hours of effort in a day can be allocated for problem solving.
